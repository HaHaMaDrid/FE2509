We know for correlated normal random variables $P_1$ and $P_2$, their summation is also a normal distribution, which has mean equal to $P_1$ + $P_2$, standard deviation equal to $\sigma=\sqrt{ \sigma_{1}^2 + \sigma_{2}^2 + 2\rho\sigma_1 \sigma_2}$.

We also know the inverse cumulative distribution function of a normal distribution N($\mu,\sigma$) is

$$\begin{align*}
F^{-1}(p)
&= \mu + \sigma \sqrt{2} erf^{-1}(2p-1), p\in (0,1)
\end{align*}$$

So we have
$$\begin{align*}
R(P_1+P_2)
&= VaR(\alpha)\\
&= S_1 + S_2 + \sqrt{ \sigma_{1}^2 + \sigma_{2}^2 + 2\rho\sigma_1 \sigma_2}  \sqrt{2} erf^{-1}(2\alpha-1)\\
\end{align*}$$

where $1-\alpha$ is the confidence level, erf(x) is defined as $erf(x)=\frac{2}{\sqrt \pi}\int_{0}^{x}e^{-t^2}dt$.


We also have

$$\begin{align*}
R(P_1)+R(P_2)
&= VaR_1(\alpha)+VaR_2(\alpha)\\
&= [S_1 + \sigma_1  \sqrt{2} erf^{-1}(2\alpha-1)] + [S_2 + \sigma_2  \sqrt{2} erf^{-1}(2\alpha-1)]\\
&= S_1 + S_2 + (\sigma_1 + \sigma_2)  \sqrt{2} erf^{-1}(2\alpha-1)\\
&= S_1 + S_2 + \sqrt{ \sigma_{1}^2 + \sigma_{2}^2 + 2\sigma_1 \sigma_2}  \sqrt{2} erf^{-1}(2\alpha-1)\\
\end{align*}$$

Because $\rho \in [0,1]$, comparing the two formula above, we can draw a conculsion
$$\begin{align*}
R(P_1+P_2) \leq R(P_1)+R(P_2)
\end{align*}$$

## Problem 2

>__Consider  daily stock price  data  in the  file Stock_FX_Bond.csv. Use only the 
>first 500 prices on each  stock.  The following R code reads the  data and 
>extracts the  first  500 prices for five stocks. "AC" in the variables' names 
>means "adjusted closing" price.__

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hide'}
dat = read.csv("Rlab9_Stock_FX_Bond.csv" ,header=T)
prices = as.matrix(dat[1:500,c(3,5,7,9,11)])
```

>__(a) What are the sample mean vector and sample covariance matrix  of the 
>499 returns on these stocks?__

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
r=diff(prices,1)
smv = colMeans(r)
ecm = var(r)
cat("sample mean vector is as follows:")
smv
cat("sample covariance matrix is as follows:")
ecm
```

>__(b) How many shares of each stock should one buy to invest $50 million in an 
>equally weighted portfolio? Use the prices at the end of the series, e.g., prices[
>500,]__.

To invest $50 million in an equally weighted portfolio means to invest $10 million to each stocks.
So the respective share number for each stock is as follows:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
S=50000000
floor(S/5/prices[500,])
```

>__(c) What is the one-day VaR(0.1) for this equally weighted  portfolio?  Use a 
>parametric VaR assuming normality.__

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
w=matrix(rep(0.2,5))
m=smv %*% w
sigma=sqrt(t(w) %*% ecm %*% w)
# -S*(m+qnorm(0.1) *sigma) # the same result
var1day=-S*qnorm(0.1, mean = m, sd = sigma)
var1day
```

>__(d)  What is the five-day  VaR(0.1) for this portfolio? Use a parametric VaR 
>assuming normality. You can assume that the daily returns are uncorrelated.__

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
var5day=-S*qnorm(0.1, mean = 5*m, sd = sqrt(5)*sigma)
var5day
```
